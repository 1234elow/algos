Simple Algorithms
===================

A basic project to use some simple algorithms.


Linear Search
-------------
This  algorithm runs in 𝛳 (𝑛) iterations in the worst case.

+ To compile use `make`
+ Run as `./search.out`

Sorting
-----------

To do

+ Create file `sort.cpp`
+ **Pick one to implement** (They all use 𝛳 (𝑛²) iterations) 
+ Compile with `make sort`
+ Run as `./sort.out`
